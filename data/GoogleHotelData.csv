Very nicely done and thought out dishes that pair very interesting flavours. Can definitely see international influence on the menu from duck ramen to Polish goose meat and Italian Gorgonzola.
My salad with goose was fantastic — super fresh especially with the pear pairing. The buckwheat was a bit too oily.
I also tried the beef tartare — not sure about the mayonnaise. It didn’t add anything to the meal nor elevated it. The focaccia that was served along was quite old and dry which I shared with the server. Regardless the meat was done nicely.

What I appreciate is a very nice design of the place, though the tables are a bit too low and uncomfortable for dining.

Food was looking pretty and that's about it. The taste was nowhere to be found in all of the courses. I never believed tomato risotto can be made that bad - super overcooked and tasteless basically. Porchetta was the only good dish. The desserts could be skipped altogether.

The location in Kasimierz is quiet and easy to find. On the market square in front of the hotel you can park for a fee (expensive) and unload easily. There is a cheap parking option (24 hours and guarded) not far away. The room was fitted with parquet floors and was inside, i.e. there was no window to the outside but to the hallway. Fresh air was supplied by an automatic fan, no louder than an air conditioner. It was large and very clean. Room service was great!
We had booked the Christmas package with dinner & brunch. Looking back, the food was delicious but we had expected a lot more for this price. The service was very rushed, the courses were served too quickly and breaks were only taken after we asked. That's what we would have expected at least from a 4-star hotel and dinner.
The Christmas brunch turned out to be a normal breakfast, an excellent breakfast with fresh made egg dishes, but it was no different to the other breakfast days.  And that was disappointing, as it was included in the package.
The manager was present, but we would have liked him to have a better demeanor. For example, at dinner he first looked after his ""regulars"" (bilingual) and then gave the rest of the guests a quick chat in English. We were there for a week, one of the few long-term guests during that time, and he didn't really need to ask how we were enjoying it. What a pity!
The reception was unfortunately not helpful at all. Parking in front of the hotel was free on all Christmas Days, but that wasn't mentioned. There were also no recommendations for restaurants or places to visit, which is unusual. We didn't have dinner in the hotel's own restaurant, as we weren't impressed by the menu of classic dishes given the wide range of choices in the area. Perhaps this could be improved. Conclusion: It was a nice stay and we would come back. However, we wouldn't book the Christmas package again, as the price-performance ratio wasn't right for us and we expected a lot more for 4 stars.  In general, the hotel is a little old and could do with a bit of sprucing up, not in terms of cleanliness and functionality but rather in terms of wear and tear on carpets, runners, etc.",https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/a-/ALV-UjVUNPaFxuFscpyH2m4JJDTrZ75WAPnFHmAn2YZ-o25KgI3tVLU=s128-c0x00000000-cc-rp-mo-ba5

We booked a room with shower over a bath, but sadly only had a shower. I told reception the day we checked in to be told they're full and couldn't change rooms, and this was just the start of our problems.

The room.
We had a really uncomfortable bed with flat pillows, that's left me with back pain. You sank into it and made you feel like you were sleeping on a slant. It was quite an odd bed. We were given room 401, it was right next to the elevator so we had a lot of mechanical noise off that. The next noisy thing was the daily drilling and banging, late at night, 10pm at 2:30am in the morning. It was ridiculous and never experienced anything like this at a hotel. Which kept us awake, with the terrible bed, we both had an awful night sleep. In Hotel Rubinstein's defence I do think the drilling was coming from the building next door, but can't be sure. However, I told reception hoping they would resolve the issue, but only confirmed that Hotel Rubinstein does not have any works going on but did say something quite bizarre, that maybe it was a guest to which I asked, ""if it were, would you not be worried about a guest using a hammer drill 2:30am?"" But this also fell on deaf ears.

Only 1 window which overlooked other rooms and the backend of a glass elevator.

Food and drink.
Our breakfast was included, hot food was nice but only consisted of a choice of fried eggs, scrambled eggs, hotdog sausages. It's not buffet, you have to order it. The continental breakfast is buffet.

We never tried the evening meal, there are so many restaurants around with plenty of choice and are all reasonably priced. Which is part of the reason why we never dined at Rubinstein, the main reason was we were charged 96.91 Pl for two single jack Daniels and cokes. It was quite costly. Im sure the food is very tasty, but when other establishments are costing around 100 - 200 Pl for food and drinks, 96.91 just for two drinks is a bit too much.

The outside.
It's in the historic Jewish Quarter where Schindlers list was filmed. There is plenty to see and do just on the square outside, but beware the two restaurants either side of the Rubinstein, they will hustle you into their restaurant every time you walk past. It gets quite tiring when you only going back to your hotel room.

Shame, we had high hopes, would love to know who thought it was a good idea to use a hammer drill 2:30am every night.",https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/a-/ALV-UjWvqoIQeVA_93YSTsYrihmveGWt79tnZftAFNrJv6-DA01qGItJ=s128-c0x00000000-cc-rp-mo-ba2

However at Hotel Copernicus these 5 stars shining most brilliantly in the sky of hotels are pale in comparison to the pleasant smiling faced stars  , in the doorways  ,  the hallways , behind the concierge desk reception desk, the restaurants.
Polish people are very cordial overall cannot be doubted but the staff at this hotel is exceptional.

One has hardly entered the doors when  a reception team welcomes every member of the family individually  and take you to the room efficiently.

I being a discerning    observer of people can write a paragraph on the excellence of service of every employee but I cannot finish the review without mentioning a few words about the Gen manager Joanna who carries a perennial smile on her face and puts a sincere effort to  make every guests stay   indelible .

This letter would not be consummate if I forget to acknowledge  the service and innocent smile of Piotr who is a proud father of  a 3 year old.

It is located on the beautiful cobbled square in the heart of the Jewish Quarter. It’s surrounded by Jewish community and history and it is a very special place. The area is beautiful and has everything you need. You are close to all of the historical sites and also many other things you have to do whilst in Kazimierz.

The hotel is luxurious, extremely clean and feels like you’re home. It’s warm and friendly. It has a real “Mikdash Ma’At” vibe, which is Hebrew for “little sanctuary” and it truly is. I will be returning again. My room was lovely and had all the mod cons you need and expect but within a very traditional room with lots of character. The bed was very comfortable, the room temperature could be easily adjusted with an in room control, the TV had all the channels and Apps you wanted, and the fridge was very cold and surprisingly spacious. I am Diabetic and I was able to store insulin, drinks and milk in the fridge with ease.

The staff were amazingly kind and helpful. They provided me with a bowl and spoon for my room, to use for my own self-catered breakfast. They cleaned my room and changed my sheets on request. They even let me borrow a phone charger on my first night as I had the wrong type of adapter.

There is someone awake and on reception throughout the night. They are aware of every person that enters the building and the hotel is just the right size for them to know who’s supposed to be there and who isn’t. I felt very secure. The location of the hotel is very community orientated too. Quiet and familiar.

You do not have to be Jewish to stay here, but if you are, know that you will be accepted and 100% safe both in the hotel and surrounding area.

Location, jacuzzi tub in the most expensive room
Cons
Where to start... The bed was extremely uncomfortable, the breakfast very basic, the front desk nice but recommended the taxi driver to take us to the airport who was extremely slow, incapable of putting the suitcase into the boot and charged us apparently twice the normal price. The expensive room with the jacuzzi had approach through the garden which in summer maybe nice, but in winter the need to basically go outside and wear coats to for instance eat breakfast, was far from ideal.

The rooms have retro style, which is a really nice feeling and the equipment (beds, shower etc.) is high quality. You can feel that the rooms are clean and well equipped at every detail.
The reception, and rest of the team is also very helpful and friendly.

Breakfast on the other hands needs some improvement. Feels like their meal concept is also retro, remained loyal to 70's 80's of Poland.
Second detail is air conditioning, they are also quite old school and quite loud. But you almost never need it since the windows are wide and the room gets a lot of air.

Regarding parking: there are many public parking spots available right in front of the hotel. You can park there between 20:00-10:00 + the entire weekend for free. If you prefer to not drive for a day or so, the hotel has a private and secure parking spot in the back that costs 60pln per night.

At first glance, it seems like a great place—part of a renowned chain, relatively new, with spacious rooms, a comfy bed, a shower cabin, and decent breakfast options. But what you don’t know is what awaits you at night.

Some rooms in this hotel face an inner courtyard, which is completely enclosed by the facades of four buildings. Inside this courtyard are the air conditioning units. If you're lucky enough (like I was) to get a room facing this courtyard, brace yourself for a night straight out of a horror movie. The steady humming of several air conditioning units creates a maddening resonance. And when the night falls and everything else is quiet, that sound will haunt you everywhere.

At around 2 a.m., when you’re on the verge of losing your sanity, the only thing that might save you is a pair of noise-canceling headphones with music playing—because those subtle vibrations even reach your pillow. But after a few hours, the battery of your headphones will die, and trust me, the living will envy the dead.

The hotel reception is fully aware of this nightmare and greets you with a devilish smile when you show up at 2 a.m., saying, ""Haha, no other rooms available.""

The negative comes from the restaurant which was catastrophe! On Friday evening I go there hungry and order vegetarian soup with chanterelles. I love those mushrooms, so my expectations were very high. What I received... The vegetarian stock was frozen and heated, the chanterelles as well and the consistency of the soup was something horrible. The chanterelles tasted like old snails.
As a main course I ordered pork loin with potatocake and asparagus. Same thing... the pork loin was precooked -> frozen -> heated -> served. The consistency and taste of it was like eating shoe bottom and had problems even cutting a slice. Asparagus was not fresh (and now is asparagus season!) and the potato cake was microwaved.

Proximity to the nearby cemetery isn't a downside—it actually adds to the peace, providing a restful atmosphere after a long day exploring Krakow.

We also got blamed for bringing them from Prague, which wasn't the case. There's also no air conditioning.

The towels looked like they hadn't been washed in years and there were marks in the bathroom from previous guests.

The service in the restaurant also left much to be desired. The waiters were unresponsive and extremely slow. The ordered dishes did not appear on the table for a long time, and when they were finally served, they left much to be desired in quality. I'm sorry, but for these prices I expect something more sophisticated.

The hotel's internet connection was also a frequent source of frustration. The speed was terribly slow and the connection dropped out frequently.

Another disadvantage that sleep is not possible. After sleeping literally less than 2 hours I wasn’t able to fall asleep because of the noise. Bed - very uncomfortable.

I liked: The hotel is close to the city center. The price was OK compared to other hotels with similar location. The workers were kind and helpful, and they were speaking also English. The breakfast was delicious, even a few types of fruits were available most day. You could also get warm breakfast by choosing from two types of eggs and sausages. Water, tea or coffee placed in the room could be consumed for free. The liquid hand soap had nice smell. The cleaning of the room was scheduled well not to disturb the guest.
I didn't like: The breakfast is only from 7, so you may not be able to eat if you plan to go to other city that day. The food selection is small, which can be a problem if you stay longer. Some people were shutting the door loudly in the night. It would be worth thinking about doors/ locks closing more quietly. On the other hand, the TV turned off itself around 23:15 even if you watched it very quiet. Although the room was not small, due to the layout it was hard to place things somewhere from the suitcase or pack. It would be worth to reconsider the layout leaving place for the guests belongings.

Our friends took the first floor room which was large and roomy we took the 2nd floor room which was pokey and small with 4 small coat hangers.  We asked to be moved but the surly receptionist said we couldn't until the morning.  We decided to stay in the room as it was only a base to sleep.

The construction site outside is a good replacement for the alarm clock and wakes you up 6 AM even if you arrived at 3 AM. Closing the window doesn't help that much, and you can't do that, because of the smell in the room.

However, I warn you that two dishes are only for the brave because the portions are large. Wine also appeared, although it is not served yet, only displayed. Pink Austria is worth attention and Blanc from the Polish Vineyard Amelie for those who like delicacy and a little more sweetness in wine. Of course, there is also Poles' favorite wine, Primitivo.

At first glance, it seems like a great place—part of a renowned chain, relatively new, with spacious rooms, a comfy bed, a shower cabin, and decent breakfast options. But what you don’t know is what awaits you at night.

Some rooms in this hotel face an inner courtyard, which is completely enclosed by the facades of four buildings. Inside this courtyard are the air conditioning units. If you're lucky enough (like I was) to get a room facing this courtyard, brace yourself for a night straight out of a horror movie. The steady humming of several air conditioning units creates a maddening resonance. And when the night falls and everything else is quiet, that sound will haunt you everywhere.

At around 2 a.m., when you’re on the verge of losing your sanity, the only thing that might save you is a pair of noise-canceling headphones with music playing—because those subtle vibrations even reach your pillow. But after a few hours, the battery of your headphones will die, and trust me, the living will envy the dead.

The hotel reception is fully aware of this nightmare and greets you with a devilish smile when you show up at 2 a.m., saying, ""Haha, no other rooms available.""

Highly recommended for those looking to test their mental endurance. For everyone else, my advice is simple: RUN...",https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/a/ACg8ocI4glJaNtLBuQxVgPo3SLBXmgoBUYK-EiWM-dBhn-eWNpYGpw=s128-c0x00000000-cc-rp-mo

The presentation of food in the buffet was excellent- always full plates and trays with lavish quantities. The smoked salmon and freshly cut prosciutto were my favorites, as well as pickled mushrooms.
The location is exceptional too- within a walking distance from all major sights and the train station, 30 meters from the old city main square, yet in a quiet street.

Big minus for cleaning staff. Thats how WC floor looks after cleaning, floor is full of hair.
Disgusting…",https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/a-/ALV-UjVpyhmL5ufT8I-TD7eZPwIhmFs0Z1okxPamWQ38bF7Ow_cJaef9wQ=s128-c0x00000000-cc-rp-mo-ba3

Incredible emotions, beautiful presentation of dishes, and everything was very delicious. The brownie was unbelievably tasty. With tea, they served a flavorful set of spices, orange, lemon, and honey. It was such a pleasant surprise when we were unexpectedly brought handmade chocolates—I have never tasted such delicious chocolates anywhere else. A huge thank you to the owners and staff for the amazing experience. I’d also like to add that the restaurant offers free parking for visitors, which leaves a great impression as well.",https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/a/ACg8ocK1tM9LM9zDMMbLdZQfnfMVQIgA3nva2rtfL-hQLSekZtNHOw=s128-c0x00000000-cc-rp-mo-ba3

The location is fine - not much to do around the premises, but I suppose that gives it some charm.

The hiking trails are unmarked. Most staff could not direct us to them.

The rooms are poorly equipped in terms of chargers and outlets. the nightstands are small and barely accommodate the most basic objects (water bottle, phone).

Most staff are junior and not really experienced in high-end hotel service/etiquette.

The restaurant is where this lack of experience shows the most. The restaurant shuffles through many “bloggers” and aspiring “models” for random photo shoots throughout all of the dining areas. It’s incredibly disruptive for hotel staff to allow this to happen during dining hours to say the least.

The weight staff missed very basic details of setting and weighing the tables (forgetting specific cutlery, asking for beverage service etc).

The hotel is visually pleasing and that provides enough wow factor for someone who may want to visit it. Everything else is mediocre for what its potential could be and this is enough to reevaluate the value of service.",https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/a-/ALV-UjVRd8yoIKx4F8qEtr2-XXyhOnQMwkMa_x1ZodV0xCjHs6i8jKZ5=s128-c0x00000000-cc-rp-mo-ba3

For example; we were told to move tables mid-dinner so that they could collapse the parasols on the outside terrace. After this, I was left waiting for a half-hour when I wanted to pay. After asking explicitly, I was told ""Wait for waitress"". This is not the type of service I expect given the pricing of the place.

This has the potential to be a top-notch hotel, but the staff have to step up their game. The staff are not at fault, but fundamentally undertrained. This hotel has a long way to go before they can call themselves ""5-star"".

This is before getting to the facilities. The spa turned out to be still in construction. We paid for a room with a view, and got a view of the AC unit and trash collection point (pictures attached).",https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/a/ACg8ocL_VT7Zxj4eyb9tRQ92Ksiyo_hvtl2UK7-nlYql-Bp86iB8Kw=s128-c0x00000000-cc-rp-mo
