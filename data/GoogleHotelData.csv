While I can accept this as there are many hotels like it, the five stars you promote should really be divided into two. I would not have booked my stay if I had known the true state of the hotel. The attached photos will illustrate the hotel's standards better than words can, but what’s even more concerning is the lack of any response following my complaint submitted at the reception.

Additionally, the non-functioning spa and the broken TV in the bar, where I waited 15 minutes for service, complete the disappointing picture. I certainly will not be returning.

We recently stayed at the Piast and Park Hotel Kraków, expecting a five-star experience based on its claims, but unfortunately, it turned out to be anything but. Our experience here fell far below even a two-star standard, making it a clear red flag for families, especially those traveling with young children.

Firstly, the lighting throughout the hotel was inadequate, leaving many areas in dark shadows. This lack of attention to basic infrastructure made the entire atmosphere feel unwelcoming. The food was a huge disappointment—low quality and served in very small portions, a far cry from what one would expect for the high price we paid. The rooms were shabby, with dirty pillows and linen that seemed unwashed and uncared for. The cleanliness standards were simply unacceptable.

For families, this hotel is clearly not equipped. There is no kids’ play area, nor any family-friendly amenities. The bathroom, even in an 85 m² room, was shockingly small and impractical. Room service was nonexistent, adding to our frustration during our stay. Moreover, there was no doctor on call and no arrangements for handling medical emergencies, which is essential for families traveling with kids or elderly members.

The only positive note was the helpful receptionist, Ms. Sofia from Ukraine, who tried her best to make our stay bearable. But beyond her efforts, the hotel’s overall service was dismal. For nine days, we experienced consistent issues and poor standards, all while paying 12,000 AED for our stay.

This hotel claims a five-star rating, yet it consistently failed to meet even basic expectations. For anyone considering staying in Kraków, especially families or travelers expecting any level of comfort or service, I strongly advise against booking here. It was a costly, disappointing experience that left us feeling thoroughly dissatisfied.",https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/a-/ALV-UjXL6udy3A6Zde1rjGscP63GctpIMA6s-nEet43pK-PDU5O3X9IC=s128-c0x00000000-cc-rp-mo,cleanliness

The room is very basic but serves its purpose.  Bed with bedside tables, wardrobe, table with bottled water but no kettle, 2 chairs, mirror, small TV and coat hanger. Towels were provided, there is no hair dryer. The en suit shower was powerful enough but we did find the hot water runs out if you use it too long. Cold showers aren't fun. The room was clean but not spotless. The furnishings were dated, looking like something your grandparents would have but served its purpose. The bed was very comfortable, extra blankets available if needed. Central heating was on. There was a desk fan but no air conditioning so I imagine it gets warm in the summer.

Breakfast was a help yourself buffet. The food was delicious. There is a bar selling a range of liquids and you can take coffees etc to your room.

The cost of a night stay provides excellent value for money.

I probably would have given 3 stars however the staff were incredibly helpful. We had a bit of a disaster with our suitcase on the journey to the hotel. A bottle of drink had leaked all over our clothing for a wedding the next day. There are no laundry facilities at the hotel and we did not have time to go to a laundrette.

The cream of cauliflower soup was heavenly, I’ve never had one like it.

The location is fantastic, just a few minutes from the old town, opposite the main train station and close to a simply huge shopping centre.
You can avail of discounted parking in a small area next to the hotel which is rather handy. Staff are pleasant and the hotel is clean. The rooms are spacious and our one came with a convenient sofa bed in the living room that was made-up on arrival. It also featured a desk and a tea/coffee making facility. Several bottles of water were provided daily. Both rooms came with televisions and the main room had a large modern television with YouTube, Netflix built in, which was handy with a six year old. There is wi-fi but the signal was quiet week and as a result it could be quite slow. The bathrooms were large, nicely finished and pleasant.

My only real gripe with the hotel and it's not their fault as such, is that there is no air conditioning in the rooms. We stayed in close to 30 degree heat for several days and at night it was like a sauna. Thoughtfully a good quality floor fan was provided but it wasn't ideal.

This time, a very mean and unpleasant woman working at the reception. She disabled the cards to the room after breakfast, so i had to go to the reception and ask to enable the cards. There i was told that i have no access to breakfast even tho i did. After arguing back and forth many times and showing in my app/membership that i have access to free breakfast. We agreed that if i was able to show proof that i paid (which i did) that I would be able to go there again. After showing her the proof, she said that it's a scam and was going to make a case out of it. I paid, but that was a very unpleasant situation.

Check-in was fast and easy, and the room was amazing, nearly everything is automated with the tablet inside the room which was cool. I think the only thing which bothered me a little was the motion sensor light in the bathroom, waking up at night and being blasted with full lights without the ability to turn them down or off is a bit annoying but it was a minor inconvenience if anything, however I’ve seen many people comment on this and I can’t help but to wonder why they haven’t changed this yet…

I stayed in the corner room, there is a coffee machine with some great tasting Nespresso pods, variety of tea options, bathrobe with some slippers, TV, speaker and lastly an air-con that’s noiseless.

The room itself looked really beautiful, spacious with massive windows and a ton of light all throughout the day. Some people here complained about the noise from the street, I stayed on the third floor and during the day basically heard nothing and during the night it was barely noticeable.

Also one last thing, when I checked out I wanted to leave my baggage as my flight was hours later so I asked one of the gentlemen’s at the desk, he was very nice at first but as soon as I mentioned that I’d like to leave my luggage for a few hours he got a bit unpleasant and rude, not sure what that was about, as it’s a totally normal thing on every other hotel.

Street noise was my relentless companion all night. Every chatty passerby, every echo of a voice at normal volume, found its way into my room as if the windows were auditioning for a role in Amplify Everything.

I understand street noise may come hand in hand with the location- but then there was the bathroom. The scent coming from the sink was more “city sewer chic” than spa retreat, thanks to some clear plumbing issues.

Now, credit where it’s due: two of the front desk staff were delightful and went out of their way to be helpful and accommodating of our group. We had clear communication and were on very good terms. But then there was Yvonne. Unfortunately our encounters with her were terrible enough to seal this hotel as a place I would not like to return to. At 10 pm she asked our group to be quiet, and we moved to the downstairs communal area. She then proceeded to yell at them, scream at a group leader in front of students and compare our Jewish students to pigs.

The location in Kasimierz is quiet and easy to find. On the market square in front of the hotel you can park for a fee (expensive) and unload easily. There is a cheap parking option (24 hours and guarded) not far away. The room was fitted with parquet floors and was inside, i.e. there was no window to the outside but to the hallway. Fresh air was supplied by an automatic fan, no louder than an air conditioner. It was large and very clean. Room service was great!
We had booked the Christmas package with dinner & brunch. Looking back, the food was delicious but we had expected a lot more for this price. The service was very rushed, the courses were served too quickly and breaks were only taken after we asked. That's what we would have expected at least from a 4-star hotel and dinner.
The Christmas brunch turned out to be a normal breakfast, an excellent breakfast with fresh made egg dishes, but it was no different to the other breakfast days.  And that was disappointing, as it was included in the package.
The manager was present, but we would have liked him to have a better demeanor. For example, at dinner he first looked after his ""regulars"" (bilingual) and then gave the rest of the guests a quick chat in English. We were there for a week, one of the few long-term guests during that time, and he didn't really need to ask how we were enjoying it. What a pity!
The reception was unfortunately not helpful at all. Parking in front of the hotel was free on all Christmas Days, but that wasn't mentioned. There were also no recommendations for restaurants or places to visit, which is unusual. We didn't have dinner in the hotel's own restaurant, as we weren't impressed by the menu of classic dishes given the wide range of choices in the area. Perhaps this could be improved. Conclusion: It was a nice stay and we would come back. However, we wouldn't book the Christmas package again, as the price-performance ratio wasn't right for us and we expected a lot more for 4 stars.  In general, the hotel is a little old and could do with a bit of sprucing up, not in terms of cleanliness and functionality but rather in terms of wear and tear on carpets, runners, etc.",https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/a-/ALV-UjVUNPaFxuFscpyH2m4JJDTrZ75WAPnFHmAn2YZ-o25KgI3tVLU=s128-c0x00000000-cc-rp-mo-ba5,price

We booked a room with shower over a bath, but sadly only had a shower. I told reception the day we checked in to be told they're full and couldn't change rooms, and this was just the start of our problems.

The room.
We had a really uncomfortable bed with flat pillows, that's left me with back pain. You sank into it and made you feel like you were sleeping on a slant. It was quite an odd bed. We were given room 401, it was right next to the elevator so we had a lot of mechanical noise off that. The next noisy thing was the daily drilling and banging, late at night, 10pm at 2:30am in the morning. It was ridiculous and never experienced anything like this at a hotel. Which kept us awake, with the terrible bed, we both had an awful night sleep. In Hotel Rubinstein's defence I do think the drilling was coming from the building next door, but can't be sure. However, I told reception hoping they would resolve the issue, but only confirmed that Hotel Rubinstein does not have any works going on but did say something quite bizarre, that maybe it was a guest to which I asked, ""if it were, would you not be worried about a guest using a hammer drill 2:30am?"" But this also fell on deaf ears.

Only 1 window which overlooked other rooms and the backend of a glass elevator.

Food and drink.
Our breakfast was included, hot food was nice but only consisted of a choice of fried eggs, scrambled eggs, hotdog sausages. It's not buffet, you have to order it. The continental breakfast is buffet.

We never tried the evening meal, there are so many restaurants around with plenty of choice and are all reasonably priced. Which is part of the reason why we never dined at Rubinstein, the main reason was we were charged 96.91 Pl for two single jack Daniels and cokes. It was quite costly. Im sure the food is very tasty, but when other establishments are costing around 100 - 200 Pl for food and drinks, 96.91 just for two drinks is a bit too much.

The outside.
It's in the historic Jewish Quarter where Schindlers list was filmed. There is plenty to see and do just on the square outside, but beware the two restaurants either side of the Rubinstein, they will hustle you into their restaurant every time you walk past. It gets quite tiring when you only going back to your hotel room.

Shame, we had high hopes, would love to know who thought it was a good idea to use a hammer drill 2:30am every night.",https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/a-/ALV-UjWvqoIQeVA_93YSTsYrihmveGWt79tnZftAFNrJv6-DA01qGItJ=s128-c0x00000000-cc-rp-mo-ba2,bed

Pros :
+ Great staff who speak perfect clear English and help us with any questions with happy and patience demeanor.
+ Fantastic housekeeping staff who not only fold the soiled clothes accidentally left in the bathroom and keep it neat on the bed. They never forget to tidy up where it is required.
+ Great breakfast with delicious pan cakes (with real banana slices) , rice like Pollo kind breakfast, both scrambled and boiled eggs, 3 choices of bread, fruits, salad, waffles etc etc.. Coffee machine never broke even once during our week stay.
+ water dispenser near front desk
+ right at the heart of Jewish Quarters, always buzzing with people.
+ 3 different tram stations easily accessible
+ The two ladies at the breakfast were very friendly and happy to help us with food details.

Cons
- as the rooms are a little antique and electric outlets are outdated. For example, there is no power socket at either side of bed (annoying for couples who both would like to charge their phones on the bed). No usb socket.
- Uber taxis don't come near hotel as there are one ways and not every driver knows how to pickup from hotel. We had nightmare pickup to airport during our return journey.
- air-conditioning could be stronger. But front desk was hospitable enough to provide a table fan which is much appreciated.
- shower area is quite small and needs care when taking bath.

We had the best service at both check in and check out.
Would love to visit again.

What went well:

- The hotel's location was ideal, right next to the old town and within walking distance of major sights. There were also plenty of great restaurants nearby, offering a mix of Polish and international cuisine.
- The atmosphere was charming, with a lot of attention to small details. The inner courtyard looked lovely, though it was too chilly during our stay to fully enjoy it.
- We stayed in a studio on the first floor (two connected rooms), which was clean, spacious enough, and had comfortable beds. The decor was a bit old-school, but it worked. The bathroom was standard, but the heated towel rail was a nice touch.

What didn’t go well:

- The room’s location on the first floor, right by the street, turned out to be a huge problem. Construction work started every day at 6:30 a.m., waking our whole family :( . My father, who was in a room on the other side of the hotel, didn’t hear a thing, so it seems we just had bad luck with our room. But we weren’t warned about the noise at check-in, and when we raised it with reception, they simply said there was nothing they could do. While it wasn’t the fault of the hotel’s reception staff, they could have handled it better by not renting out rooms on that side during such noisy periods. Paying €350 a night for a room you can’t even sleep in until 7. felt really unfair, and it soured the whole experience.

- Breakfast was another disappointment. Reviews suggested there might be more variety and better quality (maybe summer time?), but during our visit, the “hot” dishes (scrambled eggs and sausages) were always cold, and some of the cold dishes were too warm. The fruits and vegetables, stored at the wrong temperatures, dried out quickly. Rather than trying to offer a lot of mediocre options, I think a small boutique hotel like this would do better focusing on a few high-quality items.

In the end, while the hotel had plenty of potential with its great atmosphere and location, the noise and lack of sleep made the experience really frustrating. It’s hard to enjoy a €350/night stay when you’re woken up by construction every morning.",https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/a-/ALV-UjVsQa7HD4FVQ4TPsbItIIe5wgRDRlB4c1JWWwm4_yboD9BrxSQk=s128-c0x00000000-cc-rp-mo-ba2,staff

My room lacked many of the refined touches that one expects to find in a five star.

A desk in the room would be a good start. Admittedly, there was a writing table. But it was just for show - totally impractical as a work space. Power points near the bed are standard in nearly all hotels these days, but not here. Even a bed lamp that was actually within reach of the bed would have been a nice touch. The TV was small with a very fuzzy picture.

They don't even have a clothes dryer on the premises. I needed one because I hand-washed a couple of shirts which I hung to dry on their coat hangers. The cheap nasty wood stain used on those hangers left nasty red marks on my white clothes. I spent a further hour trying to remove those stains. That left me with wringing wet clothes in my bag when I checked out a few hours later.

So remember, do not hang your light coloured clothes on their hangers.

The double bed was huge disappointment. News flash to countless hotels all over Europe: Two singles pushed together are NOT a double!

Breakfast was adequate for a three star. However, nowhere near five standard. A limited choice. No fresh juice. The coffee was crap.

The location is a bit far from the centre. But this may appeal to some people.

Overall, it's a charming hotel, spotlessly clean, with a quaint atmosphere and friendly staff. It looks good inside and out. But it fails to deliver where it counts.

If they advertised less pretentiously, say as a B&B, I'd rate it four, possibly more. I would even consider staying there again. However, they shoot themselves in the foot with their dubious five star claim.",https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/a/ACg8ocKPWY1M94vzRMJRtHLO6PwWenFABE_GTyhwfTpCaBZq08mzbg=s128-c0x00000000-cc-rp-mo-ba4,refined touches

It is located on the beautiful cobbled square in the heart of the Jewish Quarter. It’s surrounded by Jewish community and history and it is a very special place. The area is beautiful and has everything you need. You are close to all of the historical sites and also many other things you have to do whilst in Kazimierz.

The hotel is luxurious, extremely clean and feels like you’re home. It’s warm and friendly. It has a real “Mikdash Ma’At” vibe, which is Hebrew for “little sanctuary” and it truly is. I will be returning again. My room was lovely and had all the mod cons you need and expect but within a very traditional room with lots of character. The bed was very comfortable, the room temperature could be easily adjusted with an in room control, the TV had all the channels and Apps you wanted, and the fridge was very cold and surprisingly spacious. I am Diabetic and I was able to store insulin, drinks and milk in the fridge with ease.

The staff were amazingly kind and helpful. They provided me with a bowl and spoon for my room, to use for my own self-catered breakfast. They cleaned my room and changed my sheets on request. They even let me borrow a phone charger on my first night as I had the wrong type of adapter.

There is someone awake and on reception throughout the night. They are aware of every person that enters the building and the hotel is just the right size for them to know who’s supposed to be there and who isn’t. I felt very secure. The location of the hotel is very community orientated too. Quiet and familiar.

You do not have to be Jewish to stay here, but if you are, know that you will be accepted and 100% safe both in the hotel and surrounding area.

I can’t rate this hotel enough. Highly recommend. I urge you to stay here.",https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/a-/ALV-UjUi_OkXQabUBLrjXVmWnDueHhMbbzEz1RdQff72rRltBoFU_c9p=s128-c0x00000000-cc-rp-mo,location

The eggs ran out already at 8:30, I waited 10 minutes for the eggs, staff brought already cold eggs, there were few of them, while there were huge containers with sausages, stewed eggplants and pancakes the size of a head. Flies crawled over the food, the food was decorated with sprigs of greenery, which it was time to throw away, and not to decorate food with them.

What went well:

- The hotel's location was ideal, right next to the old town and within walking distance of major sights. There were also plenty of great restaurants nearby, offering a mix of Polish and international cuisine.
- The atmosphere was charming, with a lot of attention to small details. The inner courtyard looked lovely, though it was too chilly during our stay to fully enjoy it.
- We stayed in a studio on the first floor (two connected rooms), which was clean, spacious enough, and had comfortable beds. The decor was a bit old-school, but it worked. The bathroom was standard, but the heated towel rail was a nice touch.

What didn’t go well:

- The room’s location on the first floor, right by the street, turned out to be a huge problem. Construction work started every day at 6:30 a.m., waking our whole family :( . My father, who was in a room on the other side of the hotel, didn’t hear a thing, so it seems we just had bad luck with our room. But we weren’t warned about the noise at check-in, and when we raised it with reception, they simply said there was nothing they could do. While it wasn’t the fault of the hotel’s reception staff, they could have handled it better by not renting out rooms on that side during such noisy periods. Paying €350 a night for a room you can’t even sleep in until 7. felt really unfair, and it soured the whole experience.

- Breakfast was another disappointment. Reviews suggested there might be more variety and better quality (maybe summer time?), but during our visit, the “hot” dishes (scrambled eggs and sausages) were always cold, and some of the cold dishes were too warm. The fruits and vegetables, stored at the wrong temperatures, dried out quickly. Rather than trying to offer a lot of mediocre options, I think a small boutique hotel like this would do better focusing on a few high-quality items.

In the end, while the hotel had plenty of potential with its great atmosphere and location, the noise and lack of sleep made the experience really frustrating. It’s hard to enjoy a €350/night stay when you’re woken up by construction every morning.",https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/a-/ALV-UjVsQa7HD4FVQ4TPsbItIIe5wgRDRlB4c1JWWwm4_yboD9BrxSQk=s128-c0x00000000-cc-rp-mo-ba2,staff

The gym is meant to be paid additionally and their site doesn’t even mention it, another thing is that the gym has about 30-40 years and working out in it is just dangerous and it looks way different than on the photos presented on their website. Swimming pool is another thing that needs to be additionally paid, also without telling the visitor. In my opinion the concentration of chlorium in swimming pool was a little bit too high, because I have woken up with an exanthema after swimming in it. This is not the worst, because we have been given the room with very very squeaky beds, that when one person rolled from side to side entire room had been woken up. The shower curtain just doesn’t work and the shower had this weird seat for invalid people, which did not close. Also one of the most disgusting things was fungi on the wall and very very dirty towels. Also there is one toilet for two rooms, therefore one toilet for 5 people.

Before leaving, we told an employee to please reserve the space for us - which we thought was done anyway after paying. We even left an object to mark it. After coming back, it was occupied by another camper and we needed to cram our vehicle into another spot in the corner.

The space for each camper was the most narrow we have ever experienced.

37€ per night for a bus and two people with 40€ deposit for electricity is much more expensive than other Polish camp sites we visited, and it's not very convenient to reach the city center anyway.

The location couldn’t be better—right in the heart of Krakow’s Old Town, with restaurants, cafes, shops, grocery stores, and pharmacies all just steps away.

The service was exceptional from start to finish. Check-in was smooth and informative, and to our surprise, they upgraded us to a luxurious suite in celebration of our small family wedding. The suite’s ambiance and the hotel’s overall atmosphere were truly impressive, leaving all of us in awe. Although we didn’t get to try the spa, we did take a peek, and it looked incredible—like stepping into a cave!

Not a single flaw could be found in the hotel’s facilities or amenities; everything was simply perfect.

The staff were exceptionally kind and attentive, and the service was flawless. The hotel’s restaurant was another highlight, with the course meal being an unforgettable culinary experience. We dined in the beautifully designed ‘Szef Room.’ The restaurant kindly accommodating our request to use outsourced flowers, which added a special touch.

Our overall experience was nothing short of excellent, and we can’t wait to return! Thank you, Pod Różą Hotel, for making our wedding trip so memorable.

Pod Roza is  Krakow’s oldest hotel and offers a unique blend of historic charm and modern luxury that is simply unmatched.

The elegant, classicistic interiors, combined with the warm and welcoming atmosphere, create a truly unforgettable place.

The rooms are spacious and beautifully appointed, with comfortable beds and modern amenities. The bathrooms are particularly impressive, featuring high-quality fixtures and luxurious toiletries.

One of the highlights of my stay was the spa. As a guest, you have complimentary access to the spa facilities, which include a Finnish sauna, a steam room, and heated stone loungers with soothing massage jets. It was the perfect way to unwind after a day of exploring the city.

The hotel's restaurant is a Michelin-starred establishment, offering a truly exquisite dining experience. The breakfast buffet was particularly impressive, featuring a wide variety of both local and international

Pod Roza is situated in the heart of Krakow’s Old Town. The hotel is just steps away from the main market square and other major attractions. This central location makes it incredibly convenient for exploring the city.

The room is comfortable. The beds are comfortable, the pillows and blankets are soft. There is a tea/coffee set. There is unlimited water in the cooler on each floor.

All the hotel workers are friendly.

The breakfasts are very tasty and varied.

There is a game room on the 1st floor, but it is in the corridor, there is one American billiards, hockey and mini tennis.

There is an underground paid parking.

It can be improved:

The children's corner is right next to the public toilet, this is unacceptable, next to the reception, where guests are constantly coming and going and there is a constant draft. Was there really no better place for children in the whole hotel than near the toilet on the first floor?!

The water in the pool is cool enough not to use it. Especially when you are with children. The water is +-25-27*

The shower in the room is open, which allows you to leave the wet floor and toilet behind you, it is better to at least put a curtain or a door, which will also keep the heat while you are in the shower.

The soap near the sink is screwed to the wall, this is very uncomfortable for children, since they cannot reach there with their hand to wash their hands with soap and have to go up to it every time.

The lamps near the bed sometimes sparked.",https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/a-/ALV-UjWC3i44LZxyM2g2EH7m4ahgHSc-dPikKIpOshCYfSFlRY0u-aDT=s128-c0x00000000-cc-rp-mo-ba3,cleanliness

Room cleaning standards poor, looks like they are over stretched, only provided 2 towels when 3 staying in room and they didn't clean sinks or toilet throughout the 7 night stay. Some days it was closer to 5pm before they cleaned the room. When you have a younger child who needs some quiet time, this was not the greatest.

The no reception doesn’t bother me, they have been very responsive. The room itself is nice, spacious, pretty comfortable bed. Fridge but no microwave.

The hotel is in a very good location and close to everything. In just 10 minutes we were in the main square. Breakfast was UNACCEPTABLE and certainly not such a poor buffet for a 4 star hotel. I asked for scramble eggs from the menu and while I eating them I found bones from the bacon. It is also a big minus that the cook did not wear a mask while going out of the kitchen. Probably, he would not wear it while he was inside too. No one wore a coronavirus protection mask, except in a few cases to the reception staff. The reception staff was very kind. Magda from the reception was the best as she helped us as much as anyone else to find an open laboratory to do a rapid test as it was necessary for us to return from our trip back to Greece, calling from her personal phone. Without her it would be very difficult to find a solution.

The towels looked like they hadn't been washed in years and there were marks in the bathroom from previous guests.

The service in the restaurant also left much to be desired. The waiters were unresponsive and extremely slow. The ordered dishes did not appear on the table for a long time, and when they were finally served, they left much to be desired in quality. I'm sorry, but for these prices I expect something more sophisticated.

The hotel's internet connection was also a frequent source of frustration. The speed was terribly slow and the connection dropped out frequently.

Another disadvantage that sleep is not possible. After sleeping literally less than 2 hours I wasn’t able to fall asleep because of the noise. Bed - very uncomfortable.

I liked: The hotel is close to the city center. The price was OK compared to other hotels with similar location. The workers were kind and helpful, and they were speaking also English. The breakfast was delicious, even a few types of fruits were available most day. You could also get warm breakfast by choosing from two types of eggs and sausages. Water, tea or coffee placed in the room could be consumed for free. The liquid hand soap had nice smell. The cleaning of the room was scheduled well not to disturb the guest.
I didn't like: The breakfast is only from 7, so you may not be able to eat if you plan to go to other city that day. The food selection is small, which can be a problem if you stay longer. Some people were shutting the door loudly in the night. It would be worth thinking about doors/ locks closing more quietly. On the other hand, the TV turned off itself around 23:15 even if you watched it very quiet. Although the room was not small, due to the layout it was hard to place things somewhere from the suitcase or pack. It would be worth to reconsider the layout leaving place for the guests belongings.

I’m docking a star because during my second check-out, the associate literally argued with me about minibar charges from my first 2 nights that I had already paid for, then persisted to demand payment again after I said that I took nothing from the minibar during my second stay and already paid for those items at my prior check-out for the first two nights. I ultimately had to furnish my receipt as proof for him to believe me, which is just ridiculous. Basically calling your guest a liar on the way out surely isn’t going to make then think favorably of your hotel and want to return.

One thing I really did not like though:
we'd arrived in Krakow after 9 days of backpacking, and had to walk the quite long way from the main station to the hotel (in the august heat). We were quickly checked in and given our key and told where to go. However, thanks to the ridiculous way they count the rooms, we couldn't find ours at first and went back down to politely ask again. The original receptionist was understanding and tried to explain but then another (male) receptionist came up and rudely told us ""as he'd told us before"" where to go.

Food:
The choice of food was quite poor, the staff serving it was polite, but grumpy looking with no smiles on their face (as it should be in a hotel).

Rooms:
The rooms were clean and the sheets were changed regularly. Even though I think the no smoking sign should be more visible to the guests (reason in the bottom event 1.0).

Staff:
The entire Staff was kind and polite. Everything I asked about was answered (If not instantly then in the next few hours). No complaints about this segment except the one stated in the food section.

Location:
Pretty decent even tho nothing is close to you, anything you need can be found in a gas station across the street. Just make sure to buy Zlots since the station DOES NOT accept euros.

Event:
1.0:
I didn't see a no smoking sign when checking in, neither was it stated to me that smoking in the rooms was forbidden. So the first night I smoked a couple of cigars. When I came back from my krakow tour the next day I found a paper stating that smoking was forbidden.

I don't know how awards hotels their stars but this i not a 5 star hotel. The interior in my room was incredibly dated. The headboard is off, the ""radio system"" beside the bed was some Soviet era style electronics. It's a double bed but only one side has the bed side table and lamp. The rooms looks like they just threw in random furniture with what they had left.

The technology is outdated. The TV was not a smart TV so I couldn't watch anything else then Polish television. The iron and ironing board were dusty and not very user friendly.

The door to the toilet wasn't installed properly and lived its own life. As you can see there was visible dirt in the bathroom, visible signs of wear and the bathrobe hade hairs from someone else on it.

As for the hotel breakfast, it was okay but not really worth the price. Also, apparently it included sparkling wine/champagne but they had placed the bottle on a shelf in a bucket (above the buffet, above eye level) so no one was drinking it because no one realised it was there. Great way to save money.

Now, the staff were very friendly and accommodating, at least the female staff. None of the male staff lifted their head and greeted me when I came and left.

The first time, I wanted to ask them to check whether I assembled the bike properly or not. They assisted me and double-checked everything. They also advised me when I need to schedule the first service visit to maintain the manufacturer warranty.

After cycling approximately 200-250km, I returned and left my bike for a service visit. I received the bike back within 5 working days. They answered all my questions when I collected the bike and shared some tips on how to maintain the bike. Overall, I am extremely satisfied and would like to thank everyone at the store.

A couple of points that I can note:

If you need a quick look at your bike, it's better to call them so they can advise when you can come. Otherwise, you might end up waiting at the store for 30-60 minutes if they are already helping other clients.

If you need your bike serviced within a specific timeslot, it's better to call them in advance to book an appointment. Keep in mind that spring and autumn seasons are quite popular, and you might end up waiting days or weeks for an available slot.

Thanks!",https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/a-/ALV-UjUGAMjenXLo9Ir2m75a2rM2RtL0-_eGjXyj0kV-WaT4vRECJjJ1=s128-c0x00000000-cc-rp-mo-ba2,service

This is declared everywhere as a 3 star hotel (booking, tripadvisor, etc.), but have only two star certification, which is questionable.
Room is in terrible conditions. Terrible smell, walls are old and require renovation. Dust seemed to be there for ages. There is no bed, bud the sofa. The blanket cover has a hole from a cigarette.
The construction site outside is a good replacement for the alarm clock and wakes you up 6 AM even if you arrived at 3 AM. Closing the window doesn't help that much, and you can't do that, because of the smell in the room.
The stuff is unpleasant. The owner of the place called me crazy when I raised this questions with him.

The bed was comfortable, the bathrooms nice, everything was clean. It didn’t get a 5 star for a few reasons which I think could really make or break someone’s choice. Their air conditioning was not great, I brought it up at the front desk and it was slightly better when I went up that night but both nights I was woken by being too hot. It just didn’t cool the room, occasionally you could feel it hit your legs if you didn’t have any cover on but after a week of no ac I was really looking forward to being comfortable at night. And the windows barely opened for safety reasons so that wasn’t really an option either. The next is the shower, the size is okay for Europe but there was no where to put the shower head so you had to hold it the whole time which was a huge downfall to me, the spots you would normally put it were too small to fit the shower head. This seems like a silly error and an easy fix not sure why it hasn’t been taken care of. Lastly the location is good not amazing. Right out front you do have a ton of public transport stops which is super helpful and since it is a bit of a walk to the old town square. That being said it’s not a bad walk it was just august so overly hot, I couldn’t see this bothering me much in a cooler month. There are also lots of scooters out front but be careful you have to park them in certain areas and there isn’t always one where you are going. Didn’t have breakfast so can’t comment but it was €12.50 and there is a lovely bakery right across the street where I got two large pastries and coffee for £5 so there are other options. The little store came in handy and there’s a small 24/7 convenience store in the next building over.",https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/a-/ALV-UjVpqMEI3pA_tO7kINPUgxbAs8TcU7eulVbfnFnkdBGkq6GaKPI=s128-c0x00000000-cc-rp-mo-ba4,air conditioning

Room tiny, no aircon, even though all websites state air-conditioning. Guy couldn't offer any fans as too late. Sleep was the worse, felt like things crawling over you while you tried to sleep.

+ small garden outside
+ + very nice and welcoming team at the hotel
Inconveniences:
- it’s not so far from the airport so you can have sometimes a bit of noise of airplanes (but it’s ok, still it’s very calm and it’s so much better than in the city)

However, after staying in a genuine 5-star property in Warsaw (the Hotel Verte), this hotel was quite a let-down.

Our double bed was 2 twins pushed together. Each single mattress was thin (6 inches?) without box springs. It was about a 5 on the 10 scale of comfort...overly firm, and strangely unyielding when one turns over. And instead of a single large duvet spanning the entire bed, we were given two duvets and two spreads, one for each half of the bed. Weird.

The bathroom is small, cramped, and lacks any usable surface area as originally designed. To make some, the hotel installed short lengths of walnut-stained 2x6"" planks above the sink and the toilet. I hit my head twice on the one above the toilet, drawing blood the second time.

Huge, heavy drapes ""grace"" the windows and spill onto the floor in large, dense puddles. The drapes show their age and need to be refreshed, the antique atmosphere of the hotel notwithstanding.  In fact much of the fabric decor...the bedspreads, the decorative pillow shams, the area rugs...is old and worn.

The staff at the front desk try to be helpful but are remarkably ignorant about sites, restaurants, transportation, etc. When one asks tourist-type questions, they go to the same internet sources you or I would go to. Fortunately an excellent Tourist Information Center is right across the street.

Electrical outlets are few and inconveniently located. No USB connections.

The TV is very, very old. Hint: if you're trying to connect a computer, look for what appears to be a single HDMI port. On the TV's source screen, use the ""Blu-Ray"" option. Really!

Upon approaching, the hotel has an excellent modern exterior with fine design touches that give it warmth and stop it from being a simple 'box' structure.
The rooms inside are efficient, well designed and offer plenty of space. The frosted glass window on the shower is perhaps a touch much intimacy, even for a couple, but thankfully there's screen to slide over it.
Service is simply solid. I was under the impression that it was very new and people were working harder, but it's apparently been open since 2018 which reflects that the management does a good job of training people and maintaining a great staff. And it's not just at reception. The breakfast buffet (which offers a great selection of countless items as well as the ability to request special dishes) was delicious with attentive staff even during the busy, stressful hours. And the rooms as well as the gym, sauna, and all amenities are kept very clean.
I really have no complaints, but one small touch might be to let people know during check in when the busy times are during breakfast as two days I went at 9 and it was very full and then my last day was at 7:30 and I nearly had the place to myself.

At first glance, it seems like a great place—part of a renowned chain, relatively new, with spacious rooms, a comfy bed, a shower cabin, and decent breakfast options. But what you don’t know is what awaits you at night.

Some rooms in this hotel face an inner courtyard, which is completely enclosed by the facades of four buildings. Inside this courtyard are the air conditioning units. If you're lucky enough (like I was) to get a room facing this courtyard, brace yourself for a night straight out of a horror movie. The steady humming of several air conditioning units creates a maddening resonance. And when the night falls and everything else is quiet, that sound will haunt you everywhere.

At around 2 a.m., when you’re on the verge of losing your sanity, the only thing that might save you is a pair of noise-canceling headphones with music playing—because those subtle vibrations even reach your pillow. But after a few hours, the battery of your headphones will die, and trust me, the living will envy the dead.

The hotel reception is fully aware of this nightmare and greets you with a devilish smile when you show up at 2 a.m., saying, ""Haha, no other rooms available.""

The facilities (like the locker rooms) are also used by all of these people, so not at all relaxing.

In-fact the on suite bathroom did not smell whatsoever, just the room.  Off we tootled to the reception.    The receptionist came to smell the room herself and by the look on her face she was horrified.   Nothing could be done and we were promised that it would be resolved.

Now, on arriving in the room, there were TWO large black hairs in the bed - neither of us has black hair.  The TV remote buttons were ‘sticky’ or ‘tacky’.

The inside corner of the wardrobe, looked like someone had pee’d inside it,  large yellow/ brown stain half hidden by the broken wardrobe shelf which was on the floor and not acting as a shelf in the wardrobe.   The other side of the wardrobe, where the safe is located, was cracked and falling apart.

Now, this was a double room, but only had one chair at the desk area.  The chair had a nice brown stain on the cover which looked like a nudist had used it prior to our stay.  There were greasy handprints on the walls, sparkling in the sun - the nudists must have been having sex - hands against the wall.

It was late, so we removed the black hairs from the bed and went to sleep.

On waking the repugnant oder was still there.   After a shower in like warm water (there is no hot water in this ‘hotel’) we went down for breakfast.  One word of warning on the standard setting the Latte WILL overflow the cup.

We visited reception and informed them.  We were advised that all the issues would be sorted on our return, and if the issue was not we will have an alternate room sourced.

We arrived, again, at reception only to be greeted by a bicycle rimmed receptionist who resembled a less than pretty, long haired Thelma from  Scooby-Doo.  On explaining the situations she immediately became sarcastic and argumentative, she showed ‘real attitude’ especially when we asked how to vacate the room at 03:00 in the morning - due to an early flight.  She was extremely patronising when showing my wife the correct exit route for the morning and became argumentative she then pointed at the push to exit button on the door and began explaining to my wife how to use it with over exaggerated motions - my wife and I are both Polish nationals.  I am perplexed at how ‘Thelma’ has managed to secure a customer facing role, she is more suited to a back of house role - maybe laundry - hang on - maybe not…  Overall had a very poor customer facing demeanour, was aggressive and patronising and did not care one iota for the customer.

We arrived in the room - it still stank, and now the LED lights were flickering - if you have photosensitivity epilepsy be warned!

So, overall, unfortunately I cannot recommend a stay in his hovel, for what they are charging I can stay in the Hilton or the Balthazar.  Please be very cautious and if you do run into any issues - like the lack of hot water, the smell or the cleanliness of the bedsheets, be prepared for the staff, especially, Thelma,  not to care one bit, and to look upon you like a second class citizen.",https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/a/ACg8ocIyjIOkHGE23g41kNPTI6KR5VcQftnYc1G14so9YxBIRQyJ7g=s128-c0x00000000-cc-rp-mo,cleanliness

•	Management’s Attitude: The attitude of the management was appalling, with a complete lack of responsiveness. There is no reception service at all, and all communication with guests is conducted solely via email.
•	Rooms Not as Booked: We booked specific rooms and received much smaller ones than agreed upon.
•	Lack of Cleanliness: The rooms we received were not clean, which greatly affected our comfort.
•	Entry Code Not Provided in Advance: The hotel is locked with an entry code that the management did not share in advance. We were forced to wait in the cold for 20-30 minutes outside with no way to get in until we managed to make contact.
•	Failure to Fulfill Promises: We were promised luggage storage services after check-out time, but on the day of departure, the hotel simply “threw” us out and refused to provide this service.
•	Threats from Management: When we requested a solution, we encountered a wall of refusal. The management even threatened to call the police if we did not leave the premises immediately.

Conclusion: This is a hotel that fails to meet any standard of hospitality, with unprofessional conduct, a complete lack of respect for guests, and failure to honor its commitments.

Blankets on the beds with cigarette holes, terrazzo floors, dirty walls. Due to the fact that the shelter houses people who most likely have big life problems, you can't be surprised that at 4:00 a.m. a guy is walking around the corridor, knocking on the door and asking if anyone has anything to eat...sic!

Pros:
Fairly Comfortable: The beds and linens were decent, and the room was generally clean. Bathroom was also clean and towels fresh.
Location: Great location, just not good against the noise of local revellers.

Cons:
Dated: The hotel's decor and furnishings felt quite outdated and could benefit from a significant renovation.
Lack of Air Conditioning: This was a major issue. The room was hot and the ability to open the window at night due to the noise, contributed to the lack of sleep.
Noise: The constant noise from the main street, including late-night revelers, made it extremely difficult to sleep. The inability to open the windows due to the noise further exacerbated the problem.
Breakfast: Breakfast was good with plenty of cold choice. Basic hot food on offer but we found it good.

Reception is lovely as is the bar area, downstairs is the restaurant/breakfast room which is lovely also. We only had breakfast at the hotel, it was lovely, plenty to choose from and they do eggs etc to order.
We had a room on the downstairs floor next to the lift and a toilet so maybe not the ideal room, however, it was spotless clean and more than adequate, it had doors leading onto a small outside area if you wanted to step outside. Tea/Coffee facilities and a mini bar if you wanted anything else.
The carpet could have done with being replaced as it was a little worn, and oddly, the bed was made up with two single duvets which isn't something I've ever seen before.

Relaxation room was closed 'for another guest' after the treatment, no tea was offered and water bottle was empty. Water in the pool was freezing. Paid over 100zl for 1 drink at the pool and second time I ordered it - it came served totally different. Spa receptionist blamed it on her colleague's incompetence.

Rooms spacious and looked clean.

Staff friendly.

However three things that could be improved on:

1. When the waitress cleaned or table at breakfast. She just pushed crumbs from the previous breakfast onto the floor!  Surely scooping it up in her cloth to throw away would have been better? If they were all doing that we were walking on a carpet of crumbs!

2. The waiters and waitresses stand really close by watching you eat your breakfast...I think this is so they can clear away unwanted plates in a timely fashion, but it made us feel like we were being hounded and hurried along.   Fortunately we were able to ignore it and still enjoy our breakfast.

3.  We lost a book and so had to lift the mattress on the sofa bed to look for it and we found pringles from a previous guest on the floor

These issues are easily remedied with some attention to detail training for the staff.

Overall the experience was great though!  Thank you",https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/a-/ALV-UjW3nO7Sn1r47CQ9dzy1BiL8MXoM-RNIXza1cjzpnx03cJUtcRZi=s128-c0x00000000-cc-rp-mo-ba4,cleanliness

The management must really be on top of it. It still has a down to earth feel of most Marriott hotels, but all the amenities of a 5 star hotel. The have a massage and manicure and pedicure menu even, that my wife enjoyed. I was really glad I reserved this hotel instead of something closer to the Stare Miasto.

When I got to the hotel it was easy to find, might only be 15 minute cab ride from the airport. I was very tired from my flight from the USA already, and even though it was an hour from check in time, they had my room ready. The front desk receptionist was very friendly and working hard on a Christmas day. There was a knock on my door and the staff was handing out cakes to wish everyone a Merry Christmas which was such a lovely gesture. After that I hopped into bed and passed out. Usually I have a terrible time falling asleep at hotels but fell asleep within minutes, maybe I was just tired but the bed was comfy and the shower was hot. There is a huge shower head. And that's really all I ask for a good nights rest and a hot shower, but this hotel had plenty more to offer.

The breakfast is a full bar with hot food, veggies, breads, charcuterie board, dessert, beverages and very well staffed, there are several waiters and waitresses there but it is included in some packages from what it seems, perhaps there is a charge if you are on the basic hotel rate. It was delicious and really got the day started right. It gave you more of a country club feel. The gym was also well-equipped and I hit the gym everyday I was there. It was not connected to the sauna however, so perhaps that is separate. I definitely would like to come back and visit as Krakow is such a lovely city but would also like to come back and stay here just for the hotel, for another week during the warmer months. My wife has family in Poland we visit occasionally.

Since management seems on top of it, my only recommendation would be that the receptionist and waiting area is fine. The dining area is very elaborate BUT 1) the coffee and the bar area could perhaps be lively and more utilized if the coffee area maybe had better tables for lounging around. The currently high tops are too small perhaps make it more connected to the common area. And 2) the bar had some TV with sports on, closer to the bar. There seems to be two TVs not really utilized. 3) I was surprised but the bartender that night seemed very busy with only 3 guests, there's no way he would be able to handle a full venue, might need some assistance there. If you do these 3 I'm sure there will be a more lively crowd on the ground floor regularly which in return attracts other guests. Nonetheless Highly recommended one of the best Marriott’s list of locations, I’ve stayed at so far.",https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/a-/ALV-UjXvH6thzTInUs9X3wBByzcxjJaDdzrVqf3-Rj4uDTWLFxg0Ww=s128-c0x00000000-cc-rp-mo,price

It is also close to the main train station, which was perfect for our ventures outside of the city. Its closeness to the train tracks was however also a downside as the noise from the trains can be heard inside the rooms located at the side of the tracks and trains also run at night. The hotel does provide some earplugs to help with this. The staff at the hotel was simply fantastic! They were kind and super helpful and accommodating as they helped us with a switch of rooms to better our sleep and also provided a breakfast package for our early flight.

The location is fantastic—right on the main square in Kazimierz. The reception staff were very welcoming and accommodating. My room was spacious, nicely decorated, and had large windows that let in plenty of natural light. The bed was incredibly comfortable.

However, there were a couple of drawbacks. The air conditioning unit in my room made a dripping sound when it was turned on, which was quite distracting, especially when trying to go to sleep. I reported it to the reception, but unfortunately, the issue persisted.

Additionally, the breakfast left something to be desired. The food was good but the selection was limited, and the small buffet area became quite crowded, making it difficult to enjoy the meal comfortably.

First and foremost, the location is absolutely one of the best. The hotel is located at the north end of the Main Market Square, and you walk right out the front door, and you are immediately in the middle of the market, fantastic.  The hotel is very nicely decorated, but simple, with a very small front desk and lobby area.  Past the front desk is an elevator and stairs to the upper floors and a door on the left leading to the breakfast area, very narrow walkway.  Footnote, the elevator is very small and narrow and moves at a snail’s pace, so we hope you are not in a rush, but it is still much better than walking up and down flights of stairs.  We were on the top floor in a junior suite overlooking the entire square below, which was the perfect location looking south and still being able to observe sunrise and sunset every night for eight days.  What made this room even more special, we were able to open the window and look out and see as well as hear the hourly trumpet call from the basilica tower of St. Mary’s Basilica.  As for the room, it was very nice, clean and well stocked, but was just a tab on the narrow side, but not enough to detract from its charm and warmth.  The room came with a refrigerator, which was stocked daily for free, which is a major plus for some people.  Great touch to the overall experience even though we did not take full advantage of this amenity.  The only thing we thought would have made the room better for us was if the room did not have that large jacuzzi tub in the corner, not something we would use ourselves.  As for breakfast in the morning, it was wonderful and left us wanting nothing since anything and everything you could possibly want was already there.  I mean this was a fantastic breakfast offering you a wide variety of breakfast items to include eggs to order, pancakes, bacon, sausages, etc.  Another point to add, the breakfast area is also a restaurant serving lunch and dinner, which we did not dine here during our stay.  We would like to give special thanks to two deserving staff members we met during breakfast that otherwise would have made breakfast as bad as the rest of our interaction with the hotel staff.  Thank you very much to Sebastin and Barbara, who took care of us during most of our stay at the hotel. Their warm, friendly and outgoing spirits made us feel welcomed and appreciated as guests of this hotel.  So, for the bad, the staff at this hotel were some of the worst we have ever dealt with during all our trips to Europe, which we do twice a year.  The worst of the worst had to be some of the front desk staff, it would be hit and miss each day depending on who was at the front desk.  One day I actually stopped and asked the individual named Vlad, was there something we did to offend him.  Absolutely no response, what a disappointment.  You get the feeling many of them are completely unhappy with their jobs and are just going through the motions and nothing more.  No smiles or warm greetings to guests when they enter and leave the hotel, which for a hotel of this stature you would expect from their staff.  Now, after making this statement, not all the front desk staff were like this.  Several front desk staff members we encountered were wonderful, warm and extremely helpful during our stay, be it for directions, places to dine or to order a cab, and we would also like to recognize them.  They included Shara (Sara), Szymon (Simon) and Hitek, who we really liked a lot.  To those staff members, thank you for making our stay so enjoyable and for representing the hotel in such a professional and positive way.",https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/a-/ALV-UjV7E4jtckmHRFhG-Ov4wL51oF24q6gS5696tANFhK3ky1Yb8efx=s128-c0x00000000-cc-rp-mo-ba6,staff

Since the hotel management seems open for feedback, here are things to improve in order of priority:

- bathroom cleanliness (moldy shower sink!)
- Can't control AC in room, no point having a control panel that doesn't work. This combined with the fact you can only open window to 1cm,  it was hot for me some nights, greatly reduced my comfort.
- Slight odor within the room, unknown source
- in the spa some things are not maintained (infra lights are not working, buttons are not responsive, jacuzzy bubbles are non functional some places)
- shower heads design feels a bit clunky and not so intuitive, but this not really negative, just a bit weird :D

The positive:
- Generally the hotel feels nice, the design and atmosphere is ok.
- Beds are nice and firm.
- Room cleaning service respected the do not disturb and no cleaning signs, and they came only when requested.
- Staff was nice
- Breakfast was plenty (great sepection of meats, fish,  veggies, milks, dairy, healthy options for carbs, etc), and great variation. The hot container lids were a bit clunky but ok.

There is a GYM with like 3 cardio machines, dumbbells, and 1 GYM pad to sit at, and that's about it, no cables or more complex machines. But at least there is a GYM 👍

Good things:
The price is very competitive

The hotel is just 18' away from the center on train and it is easy and cheap to get there
Good TV to watch Netflix

Bad things:
The pillows are terrible, just not good enough to sleep in the correct way
If your room is in front of the road, the trains and cars are so close and it is very noisy. So, you won't sleep in complete silence. It is necessary to change/upgrade the windows of this side of the hotel to isolate the noise better.
The small window of the room doesn't open entirely and there is no interior ventilation. It is easy to have a headache in the morning because you don't have enough oxygen.

I guess my recommendation is that you check that the lights by your bed work and don't pop up on, so you stay with the light on all night, check that you have TV working, and the bathroom door closes without you having to push it hard from the outside to close it.

I’m a Platinum Elite Member at Marriott including Lifetime Gold Member and I’ve travelled a LOT (500 nights) so this is based on experience.

If you are going to offer breakfast, offer ALL or NOTHING. Do you tell people “you can only choose A La Carte but NOT buffet” or “one person in room can get breakfast but the other can not” or “you must PAY for second coffee” (REALLY? How much does a coffee cost the restaurant). We heard THREE groups complain about this policy and even the receptionist apologized telling us she has heard this complaint often. As a business owner who has owned hotels in the past, I know that the cost of offering the service is negligible but the cost in annoyed customers is significant. Please rethink your policy!!

Also if you want to attract Marriott Bonvoy members to your hotel, most Marriott Bonvoy hotels offer “all or nothing breakfast” so this is what members are used to and by not doing this, it is a disappointment to members as your hotel is different and an outlier.

Also please train your restaurant staff on your policies as they change from day to day so that there is consistency as we did get second coffees on 2 of the 3 days there AND were told we can have buffet on one day.

The staff told us there was a new manager and the policies were recently changed by the new manager from what was done previously. It’s obvious to me that this manager is inexperienced in customer satisfaction and more focused on income than providing a service. In my mind he should likely not be managing a hotel. Hopefully he will learn quickly or be replaced.

Otherwise hotel is great and highly recommended but this review shows how one small thing can ruin all the good things that the hotel has to offer.",https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/a/ACg8ocLnHeoBwEwlh2Y16yHdMP1BX_vTw7KlQzboPGm8vN-igF_Ywg=s128-c0x00000000-cc-rp-mo,breakfast

From the moment we arrived, we were greeted with warm and attentive service—whether at the front desk, the hotel’s bar, or during breakfast.

Our Classic Room was spacious and beautifully designed, featuring a comfortable queen tween beds and a private balcony, which was magically covered in fresh snow during our stay. The bathroom was ideally clean, thoughtfully organized, and stocked with high-quality bath amenities.

The textiles—both bath and bed linens—were of exceptional quality. In my opinion, these details are crucial, as a good night’s sleep and a refreshing shower after a long day truly elevate the experience.

It’s not often I don’t find something wrong but this hotel was near perfection. The rooms were so well-designed - from the jewelry cases bedside to hold your jewelry overnight, to the adorable pencil and notepad in the wooden desktop box, to the incredibly comfortable bedding, to the heated bathroom floor - so much thought had been put into the guest experience and it showed.

Breakfast was spectacular - the smoothies were so creative and delicious. Loved all the options and never got bored. Friendly waitstaff!

Impeccably clean from entrance to elevators to hallways to room - for me this is non-negotiable.

Staff are not obnoxiously obsequious as you get in some high-end hotels but always around and attentive to guest needs (noticed we were waiting for our Uber and came right out to see if we needed help - which we did :)

Location could not be better - 5 min walk to castle, 10 min walk to Old Town….

Solid food, they have a restaurant downstairs, convenience stores are accessible. Beds were clean but very tightly packed. Modern and clean room. Fancy door. Bathroom was fine and the shower even had the correct amount of doors (one) instead of my other hotels until we experienced the shower.
The shower was a horrible experience. Have you ever had to shower cold because the warm water has been used up? Not with this shower. The temperature of the water ranges from uncomfortably hot to scalding. The knob does nothing except make it hotter somehow, and the exact temperature is determined randomly by methods unknown to man. Imagine draining boiling spaghetti through a colander directly onto your head. The heat generated by the shower is the leading cause of global warming.

The rooms were very nice, impeccably clean, and warm, with the added luxury of heated bathroom floors, a detail I absolutely loved. The space was generous, and the bed was exceptionally comfortable, ensuring a great night’s sleep.

Water was provided daily, and the coffee pods, tea, sugar, and other amenities were consistently refilled, showing attention to detail and care for the guests’ needs.

I have nothing negative to say about my stay, but if I were to point out one small detail, it would be the pillows. They weren’t as comfortable as I’d hoped. Also, the absence of flip flops was another downside. However, this are minor issue and something easily adjustable in the future.

I also had the chance to try the hotel’s restaurant, which turned out to be a hidden gem! The food was delicious, and the atmosphere was fantastic.

Overall, I had a wonderful stay and will definitely be returning! Highly recommended for anyone visiting Krakow.",https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/a-/ALV-UjXw90p4ygxuL_H1V1f9bXhkbyaJ0MGemob-9U_nIS0uBktX8j5z=s128-c0x00000000-cc-rp-mo-ba4,cleanliness

Positives: nicely decorated, modern, fairly close to old town with the walk being around 20 minutes. Some staff were pleasant and friendly. Room was quiet so sound proofing seemed quite well, although one night when I was in the bathroom I could hear somebody throwing up in another room.

Negatives: We stayed for 5 nights. Although the room was clean when we arrived. We allowed them to clean the room one day (because we don’t mind doing it ourselves). All they did was make the bed. Didn’t clean the bathroom, didn’t replace any tea, coffee, or milk.

Service was terrible from reception. One night at 11pm went to reception to ask for milk because the cleaners had not replaced it, we were told the kitchen is now closed so they couldn’t get any -couldn’t get any sachets of milk!?

Asked reception about booking a day trip to Auschwitz. We were told we had tried too late and there was nothing for 2 weeks. What they didn’t tell us is we could book it elsewhere. They just didn’t want to know. We booked it easily with another vendor in the old town.

Room was boiling most of the time. Air con not cooling the room properly.

Shower gel and hand wash did not leave you feeling clean, seemed to be really cheap. Pressure for the tap and shower were terrible.

The key cards for the room only allow you to get to the floor you are staying on. If you have friends or family on another floor you can not access it with your key card. Meaning you have to go to reception and ask them to activate this.

Such a shame because the hotel has lots of potential, but overall left feeling very dissatisfied.",https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/a/ACg8ocIN0RrinwL0XxnD4da0vkV4HT-xVcf4H_6VFukLzAM-edyhhg=s128-c0x00000000-cc-rp-mo-ba2,comfort

The location is fine - not much to do around the premises, but I suppose that gives it some charm.

The hiking trails are unmarked. Most staff could not direct us to them.

The rooms are poorly equipped in terms of chargers and outlets. the nightstands are small and barely accommodate the most basic objects (water bottle, phone).

Most staff are junior and not really experienced in high-end hotel service/etiquette.

The restaurant is where this lack of experience shows the most. The restaurant shuffles through many “bloggers” and aspiring “models” for random photo shoots throughout all of the dining areas. It’s incredibly disruptive for hotel staff to allow this to happen during dining hours to say the least.

The weight staff missed very basic details of setting and weighing the tables (forgetting specific cutlery, asking for beverage service etc).

The hotel is visually pleasing and that provides enough wow factor for someone who may want to visit it. Everything else is mediocre for what its potential could be and this is enough to reevaluate the value of service.",https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/a-/ALV-UjVRd8yoIKx4F8qEtr2-XXyhOnQMwkMa_x1ZodV0xCjHs6i8jKZ5=s128-c0x00000000-cc-rp-mo-ba3,value

This hotel has been very good, but has had some inconsistencies. The reception desk was highly variable: some were super excellent and suave, while others were soulless and awkward: the soulless ones were somewhat hard to deal with, so I actively avoided them and sought the more guest friendly ones for service and advice. The cleaning was initially absolutely horrific and unacceptable; on my second day, I thought the room had not been cleaned but the towels were replaced, so I asked the main desk, and they said that it was, indeed, cleaned;  on my third day, I was working in my room when the cleaner came, so I simply went into the hallway and sat on the sofa with my laptop to work, thinking that I would wait for her to finish and return to the room. To my horror, the cleaner took exactly one minute and 49 seconds to clean my room, and left it, sauntering past me, smiling at me like she had just won Miss Universe. I know this because I started the timer when I left her in the room. This incident confirmed to me why the first two days' cleaning was feculent. I went down to report this to the reception without subtlety and disguise, and confirmed with them whether or not this hotel is in fact a 5 star or just a mere fantasy of mine; and if it were, and if the room was to be cleaned in such low quality again, I will check out tomorrow: magically, my room has been spotlessly cleaned everyday after that. It took that amount of charade work to get my clean room, so I hesitate to recommend this hotel. Besides this, the location is perfect, right in the square, and the quality of all the fixtures in the room (door handles, faucets, etc) are the highest quality I've seen, on par with places like the Four Seasons. To the manager: please work on training the cleaning staff and replacing the soulless reception staff, while keeping the ones that care about their work. There is no excuse for a five star hotel.
